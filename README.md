Vapor Pressure GUI Calculator 

Calculates vapor pressure for chemicals saved in the main file. 



Updates:
An array within the file stores the chemicals, this will be updated so that the program will read from a csv file instead. 
A selection button will be added so that the user can easily get the vapor pressure or the temperature associated with a vapor pressure.
